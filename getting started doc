Getting Started with Sierra DNA

“SierraDNA is actually a simple concept represented by two capabilities – (1) it provides a mechanism to connect a PostgreSQL client to the Sierra database to gain read-only access to the data and (2) the provision of 349 SQL views so that queries may be run safely without fear of overwriting your data. The views represent most aspects of the ILS system, from bibliographic and item level data to circulation transactions to reading history. Each view is constructed from one or more tables and can be queried using SQL as if it were a table, through PostgreSQL client software. SierraDNA is not an API, or a DBMS layer – it is a direct connection to a structured set of SQL views of the Sierra ILS database.” 

1.	Verify credentials in Sierra admin to ensure that user has access to Sierra DNA
    a.	Keep this very tightly scoped for users
    
2.	Install a client to access the Postgers server, like PGAdmin
    a.	https://www.pgadmin.org/ --> install on computer, runs in-browser
    
3.	Check port and server login information for the Sierra iii server (may need to check with systems admin)

4.	Explore the table structure to see where the bibliographic tables live
    b.	Review the Sierra DNA tech docs to see table structure and columns to help construct queries:
        i.	https://techdocs.iii.com/sierradna/Home
        
5.	Right click on the table you’d like to query, and select SQL query tool

6.	Start constructing SQL queries, start small then work your way up!
    a.	The SQL used for Sierra DNA is slightly modified from PostgreSQL, and so it’s best to check existing queries if things start
        going awry
    b.	If you’re rusty in the SQL department, brush up with:
        i.	https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql
    c.	Reminders of the differences between mysql and prosgres:
        i.	https://blog.panoply.io/postgresql-vs.-mysql
        
7.	There are many repositories of iii Sierra DNA examples and queries to use as a starting point:
    a. Examples:
        i.	https://github.com/plch/sierra-sql/wiki/Fines
        ii.	https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/10924
        iii.	https://www.marmot.org/sites/default/files/Sierra%20DNA%20MUG%202014.pdf
        iv.	http://len-davidson.blogspot.com/2014/04/sierra-dna-sql-query-in-catalog.html
         v.	https://csdirect.iii.com/sierrahelp/Content/ssql/ssql_query_examples.html

8.	Once you’ve created a useful query for a project, commit this query to our Sierra SQL Github page: https://github.com/jgoss-lib/lpl-projects/
